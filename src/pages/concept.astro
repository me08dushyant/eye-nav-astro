          Using DSLR cameras with fisheye lenses might seem over the top these
          days with so many DIY solutions for capturing a 360° view. For us it’s
          certainly a process, capturing multiple exposures and blending these
          manually to get sharp and beautifully lit ‘scenes’ is what ensures our
          work will meet your hotels marketing brand standards.{" "}
          <br />
          Especially for luxury hotels and bespoke venues with guests, our photographers
          will finalise a shoot schedule with your team and ensure communication
          to relevant department heads. This all happens well before the tripod comes
          out.
          <br />
          We believe our pre-shoot planning is a vital detail and also the beginning
          of our creative process. A solid shoot schedule enables our clients and
          the relative departments to having areas / facilities tidy and setup as
          agreed and for a specific time slot. The plan makes the actual photography
          at each location relatively fast and efficient.
          <br />
          Like all plans, flexibility is key and for photography sometimes sunlight
          & clouds are driving factors.
          <br />
          We aim to maximise the results of the photos with play on ambient natural
          light and styling where appropriate, whilst maintaining a strict ethic
          on minimising effect to operations and that guest experience always comes
          first.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Detailed Post Production and Image Re-touching</strong>
          <br />
          As you would expect, for us to achieve stunning 360° images for your business,
          they do not come straight from the camera. In fact most of our work is
          in the post production phase utilizing manual exposure blending, careful
          shadow and highlight adjustment and detailed retouching.
          <br />
          Our workflow takes days not hours to ensure our 360 degree photo scenes
          look ultra-realistic and convincing. Especially suited to Luxury Resorts,
          Sunset Venues or Retreats at sunrise, our style and method will produce
          vibrant and well lit images that truly capture the essence of your business.

          Our Journey into panoramic photo capture from the skies started with
          SkyCAM in 2004 utilizing giant kites and Helium balloons. Great effort
          and strength went into capturing a Bird-eye perspective for our
          productions. We were pioneered the use of fisheye lenses and taking a
          series of shots via remote controlled gimbals to make the first ever
          the stunning 360° views over the resort coastline of Phuket. Later
          SkyCAM built custom drones with the payload needed for our DSLR
          cameras and now, well that is all changed as you know…
          <br /> This experience only makes us more passionate and creative with
          our drone 360° overview photography to enhance the navigation and impression
          of the presentations we build for our clients.
          <br /> eyeNAV 360 aerial photography service showcases venues and property
          layouts with a unique perspective and we dont need to fly high to do this.
          Effectively we like to call the drone our Tripod in the Sky.
