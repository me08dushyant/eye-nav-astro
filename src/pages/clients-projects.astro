            Tom’s eyeNAV 360 photography showcases our facilities brilliantly
            when doing sales presentations. He facilitated in getting our 360

            The fees are reasonable for the high quality of work

            The quality and realism of the images that have been provided are a
            credit to eyeNAV and a real asset for our online marketing. I have
            no hesitation recommending eyeNAV for quality work that is also
            affordable. Here is one of the typical guest comments we receive
            referring to the helpfulness of these 360˚ Tours during the booking
            process. Trip Advisor comment: “Excellent Hotel” I stayed at the BYD
            lofts for two nights at the end of September, in the 2-bedroom
            suite. The room (apartment) was pristine - it looks just like the
            360 degree tour you can find on their website. I've been let down by
            so many hotels in the past when I arrive and find out that the
            pictures were taken at good angles and photoshopped. But in this
            case, that was not the case! The room is shiny and bright.

            Hi Franco and Wesley,   I know that you have been in contact Tom
            Janzow of Eyenav 360 media regarding the possibility setting up a
            similar presentation for the JW Beijing.  I just want to advise how
            pleased I am with my product which has now been distributed to all
            GSOs around the globe.  Its a fantastic sales vehicle which has
            already assisted our hotel in closing some MICE bookings.  We have
            featured a 5 minute city overview of Shanghai too, which was
            provided by the Shanghai Tourism authorities.   If you need any
            further information then just shout!   With thanks
          </p>

            Attention Hotel partners, Tom Janzow of eyeNAV is regarded as the
            expert in Virtual 360 degree Tours, is travelling to Manila next
            year. He did this work for all the El Nido Resorts I was managing
            which helped us market the El Nido Resorts very successfully. Tom
            would be available to make a competitive quotation and requires us
            to make a draft shot list as the total production cost reflects how
            many 360 photos we need in our presentation. E.g all room types,
            event spaces and facilities.
